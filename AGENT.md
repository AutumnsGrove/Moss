# Project Instructions - Agent Workflows

## Project Purpose

Moss is a thin, auditable, personally-owned AI assistant that lives entirely inside Cloudflare's infrastructure. It communicates via Telegram, manages tasks with proactive reminders, tracks memory over time, and integrates with GitHub and the Grove ecosystem (grove.place).

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript (Cloudflare Workers)
- **Runtime:** Cloudflare Workers (stateless compute)
- **Storage:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite), KV (config/registry), Vectorize (semantic search), R2 (future: attachments)
- **Async:** Cloudflare Queues (fire-and-forget jobs), Cron Triggers (scheduled tasks)
- **LLM:** OpenRouter (ZDR-enabled) — LFM2-24B-A2B (triage), Claude Sonnet / MiniMax M2.5 / Kimi K2.5 (execution)
- **Channel:** Telegram Bot API (webhook-driven)
- **Package Manager:** pnpm
- **Deploy:** Wrangler CLI
- **Grove Dependencies:** Heartwood (auth), Threshold (rate limiting), Lattice SDK (CF primitives)

## Architecture Notes

- **Stateless compute, stateful storage** — no persistent process, no VPS, no daemon. Workers fire on events and exit.
- **Four Workers:** `moss-gateway` (auth/route), `moss-agent` (LLM/tools), `moss-scheduler` (cron/reminders), `moss-memory-writer` (async memory extraction)
- **Two-tier LLM:** LFM2-24B-A2B triages every message (intent/routing), expensive models only fire when needed
- **Three-layer memory:** Core Blocks (KV, always in context), Episodic Memory (D1, conversation summaries), Fact Store (D1 + Vectorize, semantic search)
- **Skills are TOML manifests, not code** — auditable, git-tracked, no arbitrary execution
- **Owner-only** — Telegram sender ID allowlist, unknown senders silently dropped
- **ZDR on every LLM call** — `X-No-Data-Logging: true` set at HTTP client level, non-negotiable
- **See `docs/Moss-Spec.md`** for the full architecture specification

## Essential Instructions (Always Follow)

### Core Behavior
- Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- NEVER create files unless absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

### Naming Conventions
- **Directories**: Use CamelCase (e.g., `VideoProcessor`, `AudioTools`, `DataAnalysis`)
- **Date-based paths**: Use skewer-case with YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., `logs-2025-01-15`, `backup-2025-12-31`)
- **No spaces or underscores** in directory names (except date-based paths)

### TODO Management
- **Always check `TODOS.md` first** when starting a task or session
- **Check `COMPLETED.md`** for context on past decisions and implementation details
- **Update immediately** when tasks are completed, added, or changed
- **Move completed tasks** from `TODOS.md` to `COMPLETED.md` to keep the TODO list focused
- Keep both lists current and accurate

### Git Workflow Essentials

**After completing major changes, you MUST commit your work.**

**Conventional Commits Format:**
```bash
<type>: <brief description>

<optional body>
```

**Common Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, `perf`

**Examples:**
```bash
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Correct timezone bug
docs: Update README
```

**For complete details:** See `AgentUsage/git_guide.md`

### Pull Requests

Use conventional commits format for PR titles:
```
feat: Add dark mode toggle
fix: Correct timezone bug
```

Write a brief description of what the PR does and why. No specific format required.

## Code Style Guidelines

### Function & Variable Naming
- Use meaningful, descriptive names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities
- Add docstrings to functions and classes

### Error Handling
- Use try/except blocks gracefully
- Provide helpful error messages
- Never let errors fail silently

### File Organization
- Group related functionality into modules
- Use consistent import ordering:
  1. Standard library
  2. Third-party packages
  3. Local imports
- Keep configuration separate from logic

---

## Communication Style
- Be concise but thorough
- Explain reasoning for significant decisions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Proactively suggest improvements when appropriate

---

## Additional Resources

### Skills Documentation
Skills are the primary way to access specialized knowledge. Use the Skill tool to invoke them.
Skills are located in `.claude/skills/` and provide concise, actionable guidance.

### Extended Documentation
For in-depth reference beyond what skills provide, see:
**`AgentUsage/README.md`** - Master index of detailed documentation

## Grove Wrap (gw) Tool

This project uses **Grove Wrap (`gw`)** as the primary CLI tool for git operations, GitHub interactions, Cloudflare development, and more. The `gw` tool provides agent-safe defaults with safety tiers for all operations.

### Installation

```bash
cd tools/gw
uv sync
```

The `gw` command is now available. You can add an alias to your shell:
```bash
alias gw="uv run --project ~/path/to/tools/gw gw"
```

### Key Commands

| Command | What it does | Safety |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `gw git status` | Enhanced git status | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git commit --write -m "..."` | Commit changes | ⚠️ Needs `--write` |
| `gw git push --write` | Push to remote | ⚠️ Needs `--write` |
| `gw git ship --write -m "..."` | Format → check → commit → push | ⚠️ Needs `--write` |
| `gw git prep` | Preflight workflow check | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git pr-prep` | PR preparation workflow | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git fetch` | Fetch refs from remote | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git reflog` | Show reference log history | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git shortlog` | Commit summary statistics | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git remote list` | List remote repositories | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git tag list` | List tags | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw git config list` | Show git configuration | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw gh pr list` | List pull requests | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw gh pr create --write` | Create PR | ⚠️ Needs `--write` |
| `gw context` | Agent session snapshot | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw health` | Health check all components | ✅ Always safe |
| `gw deploy --write` | Deploy to Cloudflare | ⚠️ Needs `--write` |

### Safety System

The `--write` flag is required for any operation that modifies data:
- **READ operations** (status, list, view) - Always safe, no flag needed
- **WRITE operations** (commit, push, create) - Need `--write` flag
- **DANGEROUS operations** (force push, hard reset) - Need `--write --force`

### Git Workflows Integration

The `git-workflows` skill uses `gw` for all git and GitHub operations. This provides:
- Conventional commits validation
- Protected branch guards
- Audit logging for agent mode
- Consistent error handling

See `tools/gw/README.md` for complete documentation.
